# Time-Series-Forecasting-Tourism-Expenditure-of-Overseas-Visitors-in-Canada

## 📊 Project Overview:
The project applies time series forecasting to analyze and predict overseas visitors' tourism expenditures in Canada using STL, ETS, and ARIMA models. The dataset, sourced from Statistics Canada, includes detailed spending patterns by country of origin and expenditure category (e.g., accommodation, dining, transportation). The results highlight ARIMA as the best-performing model and provide insights to support tourism marketing strategies and infrastructure planning.

## 🔧 Methods & Models 
Data Preprocessing:
Converted quarterly data to monthly format
Addressed missing values and structured time series data

Forecasting Models 📈:
STL Decomposition
ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality)
ARIMA (Best Performing Model)

Performance Evaluation 🔍:
Compared models using MSE, MAE, AIC, and BIC

## 📍 Key Findings
ARIMA outperformed other models, providing the most accurate predictions
Identified spending patterns by country of origin and expenditure category
Provided insights for policymakers to optimize tourism industry strategies

## 🔹 Technologies Used 
R Studio (fpp3, ggplot2, tidyverse, forecast)
Time Series Forecasting & Data Visualization
